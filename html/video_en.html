meet Nigel. Nigel is a busy manager who
is feeling a bit stressed, tired and is
lacking focus due to high workloads and
the impact of long hours.
he's not the
only one. nothing that a few drinks in
the evening to relax won't fix, right?
wrong!
 there is Jenny who has a pretty
stressful life at the moment. she has a
couple of teenagers and ageing parents
between work and home. she is exhausted
and has no time for herself.
she could do with some support.
there is
Tom who is fit and healthy, that sticks
to himself and can be a little withdrawn.
and then there's Tracy. Tracy wants to
lose weight and feel fitter.

mentor Hannah and Joe from workplace well-being
who introduced the well-being challenge
to Nigel and his team.
 the challenge
ticks all their boxes.
 it's fun!
 it's
evidence-based! it's aligned with the
five ways to well-being and the perma
model! it's holistic! there's something
for everyone! it's social and helps
people to connect! there's a web-based
app to keep track participants complete
activities that are released over five
weeks and earn points they can even earn
spot prizes.
 there's also a weekly
challenge giving them the potential to
earn even more points. Tracy has put her
hand up to be one of the well-being
champions to motivate others and spread
the word.
 this challenge isn't all about
exercising is also about building mental
strengths.

enjoy a full-on battle or just want to
challenge yourself.

try various well-being activities you

in their organization and create names
for their team's nothing too lame 
two,

app
 three,
 Nigel creates his team may
contain nuts and team members join for.

they all enter their activities during
the challenge.
 here are some examples:
Nigel signed up to a mindfulness program,
Jen took her mum and dad to look at a
retirement village and took some
much-needed time out for herself started
exercising and eating properly she won
the spot prize for the individual
earning the highest points for that week.
Tom joined a running group at work and
started attending a healthy eating
workshop with others which increased his
confidence and got him out of his shell.
his girlfriend noticed the difference
too and they started cooking together
more often.
Tracey was in her element she found all
sorts of ways to motivate and inspire
others.
 by the end of five weeks here's
what they had to say:
Nigel:
 I'm so much
more focused and productive.
 I'm getting
through my workload and getting home at
a reasonable hour which means I'm way
less stressed and so is my partner and
I'm sleeping better.
 Jenny:
 I feel so much
better and know that I need to look
after myself and then I'll have the best
meat to share with my family.
 Tom:
the challenge has connected me to other
people and I feel so much more confident
and I'm having fun.
Tracey:
I feel like I'm working in a
different office it's fantastic and here
was me thinking I might need to change
jobs.
 I've even lost a couple of kilos. 
I can't wait for the next challenge so if
you want to be more productive, happier
less stressed, and more confident join
the well-being challenge now!
